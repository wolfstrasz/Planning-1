Modelling a Taxi Dispatcher Service using Planing Language
Description:
Model of a taxi dispatch service, whose job is to collect passengers located on the map, and take them to their destinations. The destination is known at the beginning of the run, and will not change. The map for this problem is divided in eight locations of particular
interest where people typically get on or off. These places are labelled with letters from A to H. The taxi-agent usually starts in place A, and moves in discrete steps between the eight locations using the available connections. Passengers are not expected to move except when in a taxi. Taxis can move freely from place to place in either direction, except in a few cases where the transition is only allowed in one direction. There are four “one-way streets”.
